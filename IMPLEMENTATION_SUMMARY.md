# Embedded HLS Upload Support Implementation

## Components Created

1. **EmbeddedVideoUploader.tsx**
   - Accepts an HLS URL input
   - Validates that the URL ends with .m3u8
   - Validates the URL by fetching and parsing the manifest
   - Allows optional title input (defaults to filename from URL)
   - Creates a new video asset with sourceType: "embedded"
   - Emits VIDEO_UPLOAD_COMPLETED event to refresh the list view

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/validate-hls` - Validates an HLS manifest by fetching and parsing it
   - `/api/videoassets/create-embedded` - Creates a new video asset with embedded HLS URL

3. **Test Page**
   - `/admin/test/embedded-uploader` - Test page for the EmbeddedVideoUploader component

## Integration

- Integrated EmbeddedVideoUploader into VideoAdmin component
- Replaced the simple URL input with the full-featured uploader
- Maintained compatibility with the global streaming source type settings

## Features

- URL validation with proper error handling
- Manifest parsing to extract metadata (duration, aspect ratio)
- Event emission for list view refresh
- Consistent UI with the Mux uploader

## Testing Plan

1. **Basic Functionality**
   - Navigate to `/admin/collections/videoassets`
   - Select "Embedded URL" as the source type
   - Enter a valid HLS URL (e.g., https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8)
   - Verify that the URL is validated
   - Submit the form and verify that a new video asset is created
   - Verify that the list view is refreshed

2. **Error Handling**
   - Test with invalid URLs (non-m3u8, non-existent, etc.)
   - Verify appropriate error messages

3. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Verify that duration and aspect ratio are extracted from the manifest
   - Verify that the title is extracted from the URL if not provided

4. **Event System**
   - Verify that the VIDEO_UPLOAD_COMPLETED event is emitted
   - Verify that the list view is refreshed when the event is emitted

## Notes

- The implementation uses the hls-parser library which was already installed in the project
- The component follows the same pattern as the MuxVideoUploader component
- Error handling is comprehensive with appropriate feedback to the user
- The component is designed to be reusable and can be integrated into other parts of the application if needed
