fix: Add Slate to Lexical migration support

- Add SlateToLexicalFeature to default lexical editor configuration
- Add SlateToLexicalFeature to PaymentSettings rich text fields
- Enable on-the-fly conversion of Slate data to Lexical format
- Fix rich text editor errors when viewing payment settings

This change addresses the error "You have tried to pass in data from the old Slate editor to the new Lexical editor" by adding on-the-fly conversion of Slate data to Lexical format. When users edit and save rich text fields, the data will be permanently converted from Slate to Lexical format.
